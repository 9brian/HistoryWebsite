      <br><br>

      <strong>Guido van Rossum</strong> is the creator of the popular programming language <i>Python</i>. It was first released on February 20, 1991. 
      <br>The name was inspired by the series <i>Monty Python's Flying Circus</i>. 
      <br>Although Guido van Rossum did not specifically develop Python to the standards of today, many enthusiasts helped build its speed and components to what it is today. 
      <br>Ultimately, the idea came from Guido and is being maintained by a non-profit organization, called the Python Software Foundation.
