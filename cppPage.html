      <u>C++</u>
      also an object-oriented programming language.<br> C++ is considered a middle-level language because of it's combination of low-level and high-level language.<br> The goal when creating c++ was to make a language similar to C, except with much more additionality.

      <strong style="font-size: 130%;">History of C++</strong>
      <br><br>
      The creation of c++ leads back to 1979, where <strong>Bjarne Stroustrup</strong> was developing his thesis and loved the paradigm of Simula but found it too slow.
      <br>
      From this he set out to create a language first named "C with Classes", which was supposed to be a superset of C. <br>His language was respected widely for it's portability and compactness without needing to sacrifice speed nor low-level practicality.<br> C with Classes enclosed basic inheritance, default function arguments and much more.<br> By 1983, this language had a new name, one that has been come to be known and loved, that is C++. <br> The inspiration behind this was that C has ++ operator, in which it increments a variable, much like how he saw this new language.
